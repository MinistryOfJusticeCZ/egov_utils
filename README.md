# EgovUtils
Short description and motivation.

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Installation
Add this lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'egov_utils'

source 'https://rails-assets.org' do
  gem 'rails-assets-tether', '>= 1.3.3'
end
```
Because it is not possible to add a tether as a dependency (as long as it is from other source), you need to add it to your own Gemfile.

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install egov_utils
```
